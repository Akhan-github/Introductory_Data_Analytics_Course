Read the rotten tomato file which contains movies data. Also read movies_cleaned.csv file for the movies data from IMDB.\n","\n","2. Retain the following columns in rotten tomatoes dataframe - 'movie_title','original_release_date','tomatometer_rating'.\n","\n","3. Clean the rows of rotten tomatoes dataframe with missing original_release_date column values.\n","\n","4. Create a year column from original_release_date column of rotten tomatoes dataframe. Drop the original_release_date column. Convert the year column datatype to int.\n","\n","5. Guess which columns can be used from rotten tomato and IMDB dataset for joining the two datasets in one place.\n","\n","6. Join IMDB cleaned data(movies_cleaned.csv file that you created in data cleaning chapter) and the above rotten tomato dataframe based on movie_title. (you need to have same column name while joining so ensure that)\n","- Joining on movie_title column from rotten tomato and IMDB, the join will not be completely correct. Can you tell the reason why it is so? \n","HINT -  check the movie with title 'Cleopatra' in IMDB dataset, rotten tomato dataset and combined dataset. \n","\n","7. You need to use one more column other than movie title for joining the two dataframe of IMDB and rotten tomato properly. Can you guess which column can be used other than title column for joining. Use that column to do the final joining between the two dataframes imdb and rotten tomatoes.\n","\n","8. drop following columns in the joined dataframe\n","'imdb_title_id','date_published','votes','budget','usa_gross_income','metascore','movie_age'\n","\n","9. Clean the worldwide gross income column in the joined dataframe.

Also scale up imdb_score column by multiplying each value with 10. This will help in easy comparsion of tomatometer rating with IMDB score as tomatometer rating is in range 1 to 100.\n","\n","11.
